# Virtual-Heart-Beat-Monitoring-System-Using-Internet-of-Things


    The purpose of the project entitled as “VIRTUAL HEARTBEAT
MONITORING SYSTEM USING INTERNET OF THINGS” is based on spatial
features.

     The heartbeat sensor was initially designed to measure heartbeat rate of
human body which is highly related to Bradycardia and Tachycardia.

    This system detects the Heartbeat of the person when the module is positioned on an appropriate
location on human body and it generates a result of the heartbeat signal that to be
represented by Graph format on Thinks Speak.com.

    Another method we used is Monitoring heart rate using an Android application and easy pulse plug-in sensor.
The easy pulse plug-in sensor is placed on the user's fingertips to record heart rate
data using photoplethysmography (ppg) signals.

    In this project, an IoT based system has been implemented which can monitoring Heart beat using ESP32 with Wi-Fi
(Node MCU) which is connected to ECG module to track Heartbeat of the Human
being.

    Programming code to be loaded to ESP32 by Arduino IDE. Using mobile
hotspot to setup IP address for ESP32 with Wi-Fi.

     Data are sent to database from ESP32 by ISP-Routing Thus, the importance of this device evaluated through
lecturers, Peoples perspectives was 90% respectively.
